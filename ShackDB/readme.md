# ShackDB

*ShackDB* is a minimalistic key-value storage with both persistent and in-memory storage types.
It provides a simple HTTP API, lots of security features, and user friendly web application to manage and explore storages.

In its core, the storage itself is extremely simple and consists of json files and dictionaries. What *ShackDB* provides is the wrapping around this; authentication, validation, storing metadata, convinient APIs, caching, and management web application.

*ShackDB* was an educational project to learn NodeJS, but it ended up good enough to be used for small to medium projects, including commercially.
